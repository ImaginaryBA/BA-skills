# AI provenance

Every item a skill produces (a requirement, finding or story) carries a provenance label. This is mandatory: an unlabelled item is a defect. Workspace files that hold only the BA's own facts (`INITIATIVE.md`, `stakeholders.md`) carry the footer only.

## Labels

- **AI-generated**: AI produced the substance (content, structure, wording); a human reviews it.
- **AI-assisted**: a human produced the substance; AI reviewed, critiqued, reformatted or suggested.

Rules:
- Label each item, not just the document.
- A skill labels what it drafts as AI-generated, and what it only checked or reformatted from the BA's own content as AI-assisted.
- Only the BA moves an item from AI-generated to AI-assisted, by confirming they substantively rewrote it. A skill never changes an existing label on its own.
- `Reviewer` and `Reviewed on` stay empty until a named person has checked the item. Being reviewed is not being approved.

## Footer

Every file a skill creates or changes ends with one line:

`Produced with <skill-name> v<version> in <runtime>, <YYYY-MM-DD>.`

If the runtime's name is unknown, ask the BA.

## Labels in delivery tools

On publication, the Confluence page gets the label `ai-generated` if any item on it is AI-generated, otherwise `ai-assisted`; the skill proposes it and the BA decides. Each Jira story gets the label matching its own provenance.
