# Data classification

## Levels

`Public`, `Internal`, `Confidential`, `Restricted`. Each workspace declares one level in `INITIATIVE.md`, plus the list of runtimes the company clears for that level.

## Clearance check

Before reading any workspace content, confirm the current runtime appears in the initiative file's cleared runtimes. If it does not, or the runtime is unknown and the BA cannot confirm it, stop and say why. Never process customer or production data, whatever the classification.

## Names

- In elicitation notes and findings, replace personal names with roles (e.g. "Service Desk Lead"); keep the role as written in the stakeholder register.
- The stakeholder register, `Reviewer` and `Approver` fields keep real names: accountability needs them.
- Confluence content is processed only by local models. Outside a local-model runtime, never take a Confluence page as input.
