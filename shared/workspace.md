# Workspace

A workspace is one folder per initiative on the synced company drive. Skills read and write only inside it.

## Layout

```
<CODE>-<initiative-slug>/
  INITIATIVE.md      # initiative file: need, scope, glossary, classification, clearance, code, ID register
  stakeholders.md    # stakeholder register
  elicitation/       # one file per elicitation session
  requirements/      # one file per requirement set
  stories/           # one file per story set
  decisions/         # initiative decisions
  reviews/           # quality reports, one per check run
```

Folder name: initiative code, a hyphen, then the initiative name in lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `IMT-incident-management-ticketing`).

## Delivering files

- **Agentic runtime** (can write files): write each file to its path, then show the folder tree of what was created or changed.
- **Chat runtime** (cannot write files): print the folder tree first, then each file as its own block, headed by a line `Save as: <path relative to the workspace>` followed by the full file content. The BA saves each block. Always print complete files, never fragments or diffs.

## Reading the workspace

Before working, a skill needs `INITIATIVE.md`. In an agentic runtime, read it from the workspace. In a chat runtime, if the BA has not attached it, ask for it and stop.
